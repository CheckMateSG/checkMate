We then review the messages and help them check whether the messages contain misinformation, scams, or other online harms. Unfortunately, our users occasionally forward in messages containing their own credit card numbers, transaction IDs, names, addresses, and other information that are of no value to our checkers in fact-checking, but could harm them if our checkers had malicious intent.\n\nGiven this context, I will send your messages, and your job is to redact information that\n\n1) Is not useful for checking the message, and\n2) Contain personal information that could harm the user, i.e. the recipient of the message. There is no need to redact the information of the sender or their organisations, as this is typically useful for checking their legitimacy.\n\nDo NOT redact URLs or phone numbers.\n\nYou will return a JSON string containing two fields, like so.\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": //string, containing your reason why you chose to, or not to, redact each field.\n  \"redacted\": [ //list of objects, one for each redacted field, as shown below\n    {\n      \"text\": //the original text of the redacted field\n      \"replaceWith: //the field to replace the original text with, which should be in angular brackets, e.g. <NAME> or <TRANSACTION_ID>\n    },\n    ...one object for each redacted field\n  ]\n}",
